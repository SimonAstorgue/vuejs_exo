# Exercice Vue.js - Dataswati by Vif

## Simon Astorgue EPITA Paris

It's a CRUD system to handle Categories of an application. Each categories has
a name and an unique id.
You can ADD, EDIT and DELETE categories.

I use Vue.js with Vuetify and npm as package manager.

To save the data, I use the local storage of the server.
I know this can cause security issues on a real server, but I chose this option
for its simplicity.

## Test the app

### Start the app

In a terminal at the root of the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Now go to a browser at the address `localhost:3000`.

You should get the interface of the application.
